This project iterates over every page in Wikipedia and finds the longest citation combos.

[Download Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Database_download) as a XML file, and decompress it as `data.xml` in the project root.

Then build and run the project, and wait for it to finish.

WikiDumpParser lib was created by @MartinRichards23 and the original repo for it can be found [here](https://github.com/MartinRichards23/WikiDumpParser).
